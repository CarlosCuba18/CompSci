Read between the lines
Light as a feather
Skating on thin ice
The handwriting on the wall
Just beginning to scratch the surface
Adding insult to injury
Left holding the bag
Ring in the new year
Haste makes waste
Above and beyond the call of duty
To each his own
They raked him over the coals
Honesty is the best policy
All's well that ends well
Get into the swing of things
Too good to be true
My hands are tied
More than one way to skin a cat
He laid down the law
Great oaks from tiny acorns grow
Good things come to those who wait
Walk softly and carry a big stick
Cat got your tongue
Vanish into thin air
He looked like the cat that swallowed the canary
You could hear a pin drop
Out with the old, in with the new
Absence makes the heart grow fonder
Put your nose to the grindstone
If at first you don't succeed, try, try again
Take it with a grain of salt
Making a mountain out of a molehill
Speak of the devil
The word is on the tip of my tongue
Sitting on top of the world
A new lease on life
Soft as a baby's bottom
Toss your hat into the ring
It's always darkest before the dawn
