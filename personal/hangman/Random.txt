Read between the lines
Light as a feather
Skating on thin ice
The handwriting on the wall
Just beginning to scratch the surface
Adding insult to injury
Left holding the bag
Ring in the new year
Haste makes waste
Above and beyond the call of duty
To each his own
They raked him over the coals
Honesty is the best policy
All's well that ends well
Get into the swing of things
Too good to be true
My hands are tied
More than one way to skin a cat
He laid down the law
Great oaks from tiny acorns grow
Good things come to those who wait
Walk softly and carry a big stick
Cat got your tongue
Vanish into thin air
He looked like the cat that swallowed the canary
You could hear a pin drop
Out with the old, in with the new
Absence makes the heart grow fonder
Put your nose to the grindstone
If at first you don't succeed, try, try again
Take it with a grain of salt
Making a mountain out of a molehill
Speak of the devil
The word is on the tip of my tongue
Sitting on top of the world
A new lease on life
Soft as a baby's bottom
Toss your hat into the ring
It's always darkest before the dawn
Barking up the wrong tree  
The ball is in your court  
A blessing in disguise  
Burning the midnight oil  
Let sleeping dogs lie  
A dime a dozen  
Bite the bullet  
Break the ice  
Jump on the bandwagon  
Kill two birds with one stone  
Back to the drawing board  
Between a rock and a hard place  
A picture is worth a thousand words  
The calm before the storm  
Curiosity killed the cat  
Every cloud has a silver lining  
Hit the nail on the head  
Off the beaten path  
Out of the frying pan into the fire  
Throw in the towel  
Through thick and thin  
Turn a blind eye  
Under the table  
Wear your heart on your sleeve  
When pigs fly
Jump the gun  
Hit the ground running  
Steal someone's thunder  
Bite off more than you can chew  
Caught between two stools  
Cry over spilled milk  
Don't count your chickens before they hatch  
Let the chips fall where they may  
Roll with the punches  
Stick to your guns  
The elephant in the room  
Throw caution to the wind  
Bend over backwards  
Bring home the bacon  
By the skin of your teeth  
Go the extra mile  
Have a change of heart  
Keep your chin up  
Kick the bucket  
Leave no stone unturned  
Make ends meet  
Not playing with a full deck  
On thin ice  
Pull the wool over your eyes  
Spill the beans 
A storm in a teacup  
Caught red-handed  
Feather in your cap  
Fly off the handle  
Grin and bear it  
Keep it under your hat  
Know which way the wind blows  
Leave someone in the lurch  
Pay through the nose  
Put a sock in it  
Read the riot act  
Ride out the storm  
Shoot from the hip  
Skeletons in the closet  
Sweep it under the rug  
Take the wind out of your sails  
The proof is in the pudding  
Throw your weight around  
Toe the line  
Turn the other cheek  
Up in the air  
Weather the storm  
Wipe the slate clean  
You reap what you sow  
Zip your lip 
Backseat driver  
Beat around the bush  
Caught in the crossfire  
Climb on the bandwagon  
Cut through the red tape  
Draw a line in the sand  
Face the music  
Give someone the cold shoulder  
Go out on a limb  
Hang by a thread  
In over your head  
Jump down someone's throat  
Keep something at bay  
Lay it on thick  
Leave someone high and dry  
Put your foot in your mouth  
Run afoul of the law  
Shake a leg  
The jig is up  
Throw a wrench in the works  
Turn the screws  
Walk a fine line  
Wear many hats  
Your guess is as good as mine

Quick on the draw  
Zero in on the target  
Boxed into a corner  
Kicked to the curb  
Juggling too many things  
Hazards of the job  
Caught in a quagmire  
Exit stage left
Jump the queue  
Quieter than a mouse  
Jack of all trades  
Keep it zipped  
Vote of confidence  
Exceed expectations  
Jaws of defeat  
Vexed beyond reason  
Quick as a wink  
Box of tricks  
Zip through traffic  
Jazzed about something  
Exit without warning  
Kicked upstairs  
Jockey for position  
Quoted out of context  
Guzzle the spotlight  
Break the jinx  
Zero hour decision  
Mixed signals
